## Overview of the FriendlySDK 
In our quest to create a vibrant and inclusive SDK with an open of a portion of our game's source code. This will foster collaboration with other Web3 developers on Solana, enabling them to bring their unique solutions to the open world gaming environment.

Our goal is to create a dynamic in-game platform where partner developers can integrate their solutions using our FriendlySDK, while simultaneously offering them access to our player base and improving the ecosystem as a whole. We not only provide a platform for Web3 developers to showcase their creations to dedicated player base, but also enhance the gaming experience.

To implement an open-source component of our closed-source game, we wull strategically release a portion of our C++ codebase. This open-source portion will act as an SDK (Software Development Kit) for other Web3 developers, particularly those focusing on Solana-based web games.

## How it works
1.	Players can discover new apps directly in our game, either through daily quests or while exploring the open world. This offers a fresh and engaging way to interact with different game genres, etc.
2.	Players can earn in-game rewards, including tokens and NFTs, using integrated apps from other ecosystem developers. This creates a win-win collaboration, driving player engagement while promoting partner apps.
3.	By sharing our player base with our partners, we foster a sense of community and mutual growth within the Solana ecosystem. Our open-source SDK will act as a bridge, connecting various games and apps under one roof.

## Technical part
1.	In-game platform will be a user-friendly interface within the game where players can discover and play partner apps. FriendlySDK will also include a backend system that tracks metrics, such as player engagement and revenue sharing. The in-game platform will be accessible through the lobby menu and in the game's main location, offering daily quests and challenges linked to these apps.
2.	Using Rust, we're developing smart contracts that handle transactions and interactions between our game and the other apps. This includes token exchanges, rewards distribution, and more. The smart contracts will also manage permissions and access control for developers and players.
3.	We will provide comprehensive documentation and support for developers, including forums, guides, and a dedicated support team. This will ensure smooth integration and a collaborative environment for continuous improvement.
This initiative is a step towards decentralization, aligning with the core principles of blockchain technology. It offers developers an opportunity to reach a wider audience, while players benefit from a richer, more varied gaming experience. Together, we can revolutionize the gaming industry and set new standards for blockchain games.
