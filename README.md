# RaceOnLife

Welcome to **RaceOnLife**, an action-adventure online game built on Unreal Engine, powered by Solana blockchain and advanced AI technology. Inspired by the GTA and Far Cry game series!

## Overview

**RaceOnLife** is more than just a game; it's an ecosystem where players can race, earn, and interact in an open world. Utilizing the power of the Solana blockchain, our game ensures minimal gas fees and true ownership of in-game assets through NFTs. Dive into a dynamic, tropical world where AAA graphics meet blockchain technology, providing both exhilarating gameplay and real earning potential.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Graphics**: Developed with Unreal Engine 5 for a truly immersive experience.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Solana blockchain for secure, decentralized asset ownership.
- **AI-Powered NPCs**: Smart NPCs with complete freedom of action in an open world.
- **Diverse Game Modes**: Including Car Football, Survival Derby, Speed, Drift, and more.
- **Earn Real Money**: Players can earn while playing, making the game accessible and rewarding.

## Gameplay

Experience a variety of game modes:
- **Car Football**: Engage in high-octane football matches with cars.
- **Survival Derby**: Outlast your opponents in a demolition derby.
- **Speed and Drift**: Showcase your racing skills in speed and drift challenges.
- **Crown and Bomb**: Unique game modes for an added thrill.

## How to Play

### Getting Started
- **Lobby and Player Setup**: After launching the game, you enter the lobby and can optionally scan yourself to create a personalized avatar. Select your preferred game mode from the available options.

### Game Modes
- **Football**: Enter the action-packed car football arena! Choose the number of players (from 2 to 8) and create a room. Once the desired number of players join, start the game and select your team—Red or Green. Matches last 5 minutes, and the team scoring the most goals wins. If the score is tied at the end of 5 minutes, the "Golden Goal" rule applies, where the next goal wins.

- **Derby**: In this intense survival mode, players (2 to 10) compete in a demolition derby. Create a room from the main menu and wait in the lobby for others to join. The objective is simple—be the last player standing with a working vehicle.

- **Snake Roads Island (Pre-Alpha)**: This is the primary exploration area of the game. Players can roam the island using cars, motorcycles, trucks, or vans. The current version includes an introductory mission and limited access to the island, providing a sneak peek into the full RaceOnLife experience.

### Game Flow
- **Team Selection**: Once a match begins in Football mode, select your team—Red or Green—and prepare for 5 minutes of non-stop action.

### Vehicles
